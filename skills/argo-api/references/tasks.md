# Get tasks for a specific project
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOMELAB_API_KEY" "https://argo.jkrumm.com/api/ticktick/projects/{projectId}/data"

# Overdue + due-soon tasks (from /summary, includes project names)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOMELAB_API_KEY" "https://argo.jkrumm.com/api/summary" | jq '.ticktick'

# Create a task — full body: title!, projectId?, dueDate?, priority?, content?, startDate?, isAllDay?
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOMELAB_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Task title","projectId":"inbox","dueDate":"2026-04-20","priority":3,"content":"longer notes here"}' \
  "https://argo.jkrumm.com/api/ticktick/tasks"

## Workflow

**"What are my tasks?" / "What's due?"**
→ Call `/summary` first — it returns `overdue` and `dueSoon` (next 7 days) with project names already resolved
→ Only call `/ticktick/projects` + `/ticktick/projects/{id}/data` if full project listing is needed

**"Add a task" / "Remind me to..."**
→ POST to `/ticktick/tasks` with at minimum `title`
→ Use `projectId: "inbox"` if no project specified
→ Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates

**"Mark X as done"**
→ Need both `projectId` and `taskId`
→ `/summary` gives `taskId` and `projectName` but NOT `projectId` — call `/ticktick/projects` to resolve the name to an ID
→ POST to `/ticktick/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}/complete`

## Field Semantics

### Priority
| Value | Meaning |
|-|-|
| `0` | None |
| `1` | Low |
| `3` | Medium |
| `5` | High |

### Task Status
| Value | Meaning |
|-|-|
| `0` | Active |
| `2` | Completed |

### Dates
- Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` format when creating or updating tasks
- API returns dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `dueDate` — when the task is due
- `startDate` — optional, when to start working on it
- `isAllDay` — boolean; default true for date-only tasks

### Body / notes
- `content` — long-form notes attached to the task (markdown allowed in TickTick)

## Response Formatting

- **Today's tasks:** Group by project, show title + due date + priority (if set). Lead with overdue items.
- **Task created:** Confirm title, project, and due date in one line
- **Quick overview:** Use `/summary` ticktick data — it already groups overdue vs due-soon
- **Don't list closed projects** — filter by `closed: false` if listing projects
